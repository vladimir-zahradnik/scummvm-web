Twenty years after its original release, we are very proud to announce today the support
of MTV's <i>Beavis and Butthead in Virtual Stupidity</i>.
Accept the challenge of those anti-heroes of the 90's and help them find their way in an adventure
full of puzzles and mini-games.
</p>

<p>
So, get the latest <a href="/downloads/#daily">daily build of ScummVM</a> and your version of the game and give BBVS a try!
Please post any bugs and unrecognized versions you can find to our <a href="http://bugs.scummvm.org/"> bug tracker</a>, following
the <a href="/faq/#question.report-bugs">bug submission guidelines</a>.
</p>

<p>
As usual, if you find interesting sights, we are interested in your <a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots">screenshots</a>.
