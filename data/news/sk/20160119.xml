		We have been using SourceForge.net for many years. It was the very first home
		for our project, and it served us very well. However, we had to move on, and we were
		looking for a new home. Last year Florian Schicker, CEO of
		<a href="http://easyname.com">easyname GmbH</a> approached us with the thrilling proposal
		to donate a server and host it in their Data Centre. And what makes it so special is that
		they are doing it "because they are veeeery big fans of the good old scumm games"!
		Go, look at <a href="http://www.easyname.com/en/company/team">company teampage in that fancy scumm-feeling</a>!
		A really generous proposal and completely unexpected.
	</p>

	<p>
		Thus, we are moving. First we moved our main website and downloads, and you probably
		already noticed the speed boost thanks to the new service. Also, we said goodbye to
		the advertisements during downloads, as they were provided by SourceForge.net. The only
		ads that will be associated with this project from now on are the ones we want to do by ourselves
		(and that, of course, includes easyname.com, look at their nice logo in the right pane). Eventually,
		we will move more services to the new server, and perhaps even extend it with something new.
	</p>

	<p>
		So please join us in our joy of a new home!
