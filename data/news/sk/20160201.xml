<p>
	After a very long break, we are finally starting preparations for our next release, ScummVM 1.8.0.
</p>

<p>
	The last one year and a half have been very busy, and we added 10 (ten, zehn, dieci, dix, diez, десять) new games:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><i>Rex Nebular and the Cosmic Gender Bender</i></li>
	<li><i>Sfinx</i></li>
	<li><i>Zork Nemesis: The Forbidden Lands</i></li>
	<li><i>Zork: Grand Inquisitor</i></li>
	<li><i>The Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes: The Case of the Serrated Scalpel</i></li>
	<li><i>The Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes: The Case of the Rose Tattoo</i></li>
	<li><i>Beavis and Butthead in Virtual Stupidity</i></li>
	<li><i>Amazon: Guardians of Eden</i></li>
	<li><i>Broken Sword 2.5: The Return of the Templars</i></li>
	<li><i>Labyrinth of Time</i></li>
</ul>

<p>
	Also, we had a major rewrite of the AGI engine, so all AGI games should work better, but could also have new, unexpected bugs.
</p>

<p>Thus, we need your help with testing out these games, including AGI-based ones.
	For your convenience, we gathered together what requires testing on
	<a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing/1.8.0">our wiki</a>.
	There are also a few other old classics on that list that could use another run through.
</p>

<p>You need to grab a <a href="/downloads/#daily">daily build</a> of ScummVM and you may
	start helping right away! If you happen to find any bugs, please report them on our
	<a href="http://bugs.scummvm.org/">bug tracker</a>. After completing one of the games,
	please let us know on <a href="http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=14006">the forums</a> so we can mark
	your progress on the <a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing/1.8.0">wiki</a> and other
	players can concentrate on untested games. Please be sure to follow our guidelines for release testing,
	which can be found <a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
	Also some of these games require <a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots">screenshots</a>,
	which you can make along your gameplay.
</p>

<p>
	Happy adventuring (in a test mode)!
