		While aboard the subway, your train car is sucked into an alternate
		dimension, a labyrinth that spans the space-time continuum. Its
		creator, Daedalus, is forced to oversee its construction by the evil
		King Minos, who wants to use it to invade and conquer all times and
		places. Daedalus pleads for the player to find a way to destroy the
		labyrinth before Minos can complete his conquest.
